**Home Screen**

When a user first runs the app, if it is the first run, a stock album 
will be created, otherwise, the albums from the previous session will 
appear in a list.

There will be an option to add a new album or search for a photo with
a photo tag. If a user selects an album, they will also be able to
delete, edit or display an album.

**Display Album**

When the user selects display on the homescreen, they will be brought
to the album display page. From here, they will see an option to add
another photo. If they click on a photo, they will also be given access
to the copy, paste, move (also known as cut), delete, and open.

**Slideshow View**

If the user selects open from the Display Album screen, they will be 
brought to the slideshow screen. On this screen, depending on whether
there are other photos in the album, they may or may not be given next
and previous photo buttons.

In addition, there will be a list of tags. If there are no tags on the
photo, they will only have an add tag button; however, if there are tags,
they will also have a delete tag button.

**Searching For Photos**

From the homescreen, if the user clicks the search button, they will be
prompt for the information of the tag that they are searching for. After
traversing all albums, it return a list of all matching photos in the 
Display Album screen.
